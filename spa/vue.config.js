/*
The django-vue connection approach of which this configuration is part of was made 
popular by Ejez and EugeneDae. You can find more information about them here:
https://github.com/django-webpack/django-webpack-loader/issues/209#issue-512863855
https://github.com/EugeneDae/django-vue-cli-webpack-demo
I however decided to simplify things a little by avoiding template inheritance 
on Django's side, as this is not needed in our scenario and, I believe, in most
such cases.
Note: please remember you will also need to properly configure your Django 
backend for this setup to work as expected both in development and production.
